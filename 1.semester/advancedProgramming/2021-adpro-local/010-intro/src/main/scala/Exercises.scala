// The file is meant to be compiled inside sbt, using the 'compile' command.
// To run the compiled file use the 'run' or 'runMain'.
// To load the file int the REPL use the 'console' command.
//
// Continue solving exercises in the order presented in the PDF file. The file
// shall always compile, run, and pass tests (for the solved exercises),
// after you are done with each exercise (if you do them in order).
// Compile and test frequently. Best continously.

// The extension of App allows writing the main method statements at the top
// level (the so called default constructor). For App objects they will be
// executed as if they were placed in the main method in Java.
